# Nbody-Proj
Short University project, creating N-body simulations

A set of scenarios; body masses, velocities, etc. the core functions of the code, and a (partially) unsuccessful attempt at a 
Particle Mesh code based on the Poisson equation and Fourier techniques. (Suspect issue is with the green function used to normalise)
